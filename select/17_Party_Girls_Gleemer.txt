peel up my sorrow
like I won't be here tomorrow
you're the only side of losing I can't take
he'd have worn it backwards
he'd have worn it backwards so
he'd have worn it backwards
he'd have worn it backwards so
I called your dad a liar
and pulled him out from under my tires
your uncle melted
in the gasoline you felt it
and the party that July sank through your skin
he'd have worn it backwards
he'd have worn it backwards so
he'd have worn it backwards
he'd have worn it backwards so
I called your dad a liar
and pulled him out from under my tires
and so, I drove from Colorado
and drug myself from deep to shallow
oh, wash over my lover boy
oh, wash over my lover boy
oh, wash over my lover boy
oh, wash over my lover boy
