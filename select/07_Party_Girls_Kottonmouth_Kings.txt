Look at her ass, look at her legs
Look at the way she moves
Lovin' her hair, lovin' the lips
Lovin' the way she grooves

Look at her ass, look at her legs
Look at the way she moves
I got a heavy need to party with her

Better go, better start the flow
Let the music take control
You can go anywhere you go
'Cause when we roll, we roll, we roll

You're simply fine, let me pour you some wine
I see you love to party all of the time
Well, that's a funny thing 'cause I do too
Babe, I'm diggin' you

I like them girls who like them girls, who like them girls
I like them girls who like them girls
I like them party girls, I like them party girls
I like them party girls
(I like them girls, I love them girls)

Look at her ass, look at her legs
Look at the way she moves
Lovin' her hair, lovin' the lips
Lovin' the way she grooves

Look at her ass, look at her legs
Look at the way she moves
I got a heavy need to party with her
(Whoa, I'm roll)

My [Incomprehensible] is growin' tonight
Your vibration feels just fine
There's no rules but the ones we write
Just tonight, tonight, tonight

Maybe after strip clubber, I'm free
Your friend said you wanna party with me
And I can see it in your eyes you don't want no one else
(I think I want you by myself)

I like them girls who like them girls, who like them girls
I like them girls who like them girls
I like them party girls, I like them party girls
I like them party girls

I like them party girls, I like them party girls
I like them party girls
(I like them girls, I love them girls)

I like them girls who like them girls, who like them girls
I like them girls who like them girls
I like them party girls, I like them party girls
I like them party girls

I like them party girls, I like them party girls
I like them party girls
(I like them girls, I love them girls)

Look at her ass, look at her legs
Look at the way she moves
Lovin' her hair, lovin' the lips
Lovin' the way she grooves

Look at her ass, look at her legs
Look at the way she moves
I got a heavy need to party with her

Fine enough, we do you
